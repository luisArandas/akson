Build
============

The Akson underlying code is currently hosted on GitHub on a public repository that allows many types of action. | With the potentialities of the open-source world,
and the command line interfaces everyone can clone, fork and mess with the Akson code. HEre are some instructions to be able to do that.

Instructions
-------------------------------

Instructions to build the system in MacOS

* Open the terminal

* Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. | In MacOS the commands will be ls to see what there is in your directory and cd new_directory to change folder. Most probably the terminal will open the user in :~ username$.

* You will also need to have git installed. When the terminal is opened type:

.. code::

      $ git --version
      $ cd Desktop
      $ git clone https://github.com/luisArandas/akson

After that if you don't have git installed a window will prompt to install


.. code::

      Cloning into 'akson'...
