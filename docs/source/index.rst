[Akson] Software Documentation
====================================

This is the official documentation of the Akson software, a collaborative audiovisual system using new media technologies.
Akson was developed to fulfil the needs of a research in interactive networked musical systems and complex data visualizations
done in the context of the Braga Media Arts group. It was initially conceived of as an exploration into what could be built by
leveraging global internet infrastructure as well as musical and visual playback across multiple devices. This system was done thinking
about its use in live performance and is able to interact in various ways in delicate devices such as mobile phones and mini computers.
This documentation will allow the user to understand better how to use the software, build it and if needed edit it easily. All of the features
will be covered here and how to access them.
