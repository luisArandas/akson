Introduction
-------------------------------

Ina video app interface is divided between the static and the volatile modules. The picture below shows the static part of the GUI.
When the application is launched, this is what the user will see. It is composed by the Video Mixer, the main Modules on the right, and on
the left we have the Information menus, Recording, and the Sampler Modules. This part of the software is not customizable in the graphical
presentation domain, even though the user is completely free to make connections between modules. The parts of the interface not mentioned in this chapter,
most probably will have a chapter on their own.
